    "As stated in the case description Raduga Inc. wants to know how much colors it has to make for the world cup 2018. Part of this big project is a simulation of the upcomming tournament. They want to have a statistical substantiated estimation. The simulation part of the project is given to the Business Analytics and the Advanced Analytics & Big Data teams of KPMG. Your mission is to write this simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Management team has some data available for you.  You may use any other data source you might think is useful for your prediction and simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## High over suggested code setup and points distribution\n",
    "You may build up your code in any way you want. The core coding language used at KPMG is Python, but for this 'simple' simulation you may use any language you are comfortable with. All tips and tricks will however be provided in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will find a skeleton of the code which you could use. Altough a lot of code is ready to use, there is a need to edit the code in some places. These places are indicated by \"CODE_IT_YOURSELF\". When you are finished editing the code at all the CODE_IT_YOURSELF-places, you have a simplified simulation of a World Cup tournament ready. This simplified simulation does not take into account all the specifics of an official tournament. Several improvements can be made. Suggestions of improvements are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
